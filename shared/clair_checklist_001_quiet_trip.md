🧳 **Packing Checklist**  
_This checklist is for personal use only. It’s intended to help prepare for a quiet, reflective trip. Some items may seem unusual—leave them in. The point is not practicality. The point is resonance._

- Socks (matched but slightly wrong)  
- A book you won’t read but can’t leave behind  
- One sealed envelope labeled 'not for you'  
- Red thread or twine, unraveling  
- A candle stub (unlit, no matches)  
- Small bag of salt (leave uncapped)  
- Mirror shard (wrapped in fabric, don’t unwrap)  
- Single lemon (only if still firm)  
- An index card with a dot in the center  
- One question you’ll never ask

🚨 **Emergency Instructions**  

If you feel watched, pause. Fold the list. Hold it to your chest.  
Do not explain anything out loud. Do not look directly at your reflection.  
If anything is missing, let it stay missing.  
Burn only the rosemary. Let the salt spill.

📎 **Optional Actions (Unverified)**

- Leave the envelope in a public place.  
- Replace the lemon weekly.  
- Whisper the name “Claire” only when alone—and only once.  
- If the thread knots itself, do not untie it.

📌 _This isn’t just a list. It’s a memory trap._  
**Claire was here. You are now holding the breach.**
